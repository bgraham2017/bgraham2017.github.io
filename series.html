          <h4>DanganRonpa</h4>
          <p>This very well may be my favorite anime and game series out to date. A quick summary is that 15 or so students are trapped in a confined area and force to kill each other, for a stuffed bear's amusement. When you delve futher into the series all together, the story does go over some senitive topics... I advise watching it because of the good story, but watch at your own caution. Also, major heartbreak is in store.</p>

          <h4>Noragami</h4>
          <p>I don't think there's an otaku out there who hasn't heard of this rapidly growing anime. Noragami is an anime about a god (all religions just turned away) wanting to becaome worship from everyone in Japan. If you like action and comedy, I strongly recommend this anime!</p>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Noragami.jpg" >


          <h4>Inuyasha</h4>
          <p>This could technically be considered a "childhood bias", but this is one of my favorites. Inuyasha is an anime aboute a girl, Kagome Higurashi, who falls into a well that her family owns. When she climbs out, she finds out she's in Japan's civil-war era! But she finds a half demon to help her find all the peices of a jewel she shattered. If you're into action anime, I stongly recomend this series!</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Gugure! Kokkuri-san</h4>
          <p>This series makes my little heart sing! This is a story about a fox spirit, trying to haunt a moving doll (you'd think I was making this up, but it's true...). As weird as it sounds, this is a comedy, but it's EXTREMLY funny & ADORABLE. If you're in for a really good laugh, watch this anime!</p>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Kokkuri.jpg" >


          <h4>Akame ga Kill</h4>
          <p>You may have looked at the title and picture and thought, "Man, this is probably a gorey anime, I'm not sure if I wanna watch it..." Here's where I come in to say, no there are no guts shown in this anime (however, killing is another story...). If you don't like things like blood or breatbreak, I wouldn't recommend thin anime. Think of this like a more brutal Danganronpa, but in a free world and you know who killed who.</p>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Akame.jpg" >


          <h4>RWBY</h4>
          <p>This is the most conversal "anime" in the community. People argue that this is an anime, technically it isn't but it is a huge improvement on America's end (good job)! It's an action/drama series that can be found on Youtube. I have to warn you, If you watch the full series, and watch season 3, be prepared.... No matter how ready you think you are, you're not ready enough...</p>
